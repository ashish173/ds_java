1) Hashing is a very efficient data structure. Lookup in a Hash is O(1) most of the time.
2) Collision is two elements fit in one index.
3) Collision can't be avoided but it can be minimized.
4) TWO METHODS :- Open addressing, Separate Chaining (avoid collision)
5) Open Addressing:- 
6) Separate Chaining:-
7) Hash Functions:-
